## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup and boilerplate
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- CSS Media Queries
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

"Through This Project, I Strengthened My Skills in Writing Clean HTML Structure, Creating Responsive Layouts With CSS, and Styling Elements to Match a Specific Design Vision. I Learned How to Use Semantic Tags for Better Accessibility, Apply Modern CSS Techniques Like Flexbox, and Ensure That the Design Works Smoothly Across Different Devices. This Experience Also Improved My Ability to Organize Code and Think Creatively When Solving Layout Challenges." 

```html
<div class="container border border-0 border-bottom border-secondry-subtle border-1" id="ingredients">
```
```css
@media (min-width:375px) and (max-width:1200px) {
	body {
		margin: 0px 0px;
	}

	#content {
		margin:5rem auto ;
	}
}

@media (orientation:portrait) {
	#content {
		margin:auto auto ;
	}
}
```

### Continued development

"In Future Projects, I Plan to Focus More on Mastering Bootstrap and It's Responsive Breakpoints, Along With Deepening My Understanding of CSS Flexbox and Media Queries. I Also Aim to Apply More Precise HTML5 Semantic Markup to Ensure Better Accessibility, Structure, and SEO Performance. By Strengthening These Skills, I Can Create Cleaner, More Responsive, and User-Friendly Websites."

MDN Provided Clear Documentation, Practical Examples, and Best Practices That Helped Me Solve Challenges More Efficiently. Using MDN Not Only Improved My Technical Accuracy but Also Strengthened My Confidence in Applying Modern Web Standards to My Work."

From Explaining Complex HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap Concepts to Offering Practical Code Examples and Debugging Advice, ChatGPT Helped Me Overcome Challenges More Efficiently. It's Clear Explanations and Creative Suggestions Played a Key Role in Improving My Skills, Building My Confidence, and Ensuring the Project’s Overall Quality."

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - "In This Project, I Utilized Bootstrap to Streamline the Design Process and Enhance the Visual Appeal of My Pages. By Leveraging Bootstrap’s Pre-Built Components, Utility Classes, and Customization Options, I Was Able to Maintain Consistent Styling, Organize Content Effectively, and Apply Modern Web Design Techniques More Efficiently.
